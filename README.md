# SmartGrid

To minimize the costs on the implementation of a Smart Grid, cables need to be installed on an efficient manner which have a tremendous amount of possibilities. In this project we will try to write an algorithm that returns the most efficient solution.

## Getting started

### Requirements

This codebase is completely written in Python .... In the requirements.txt you will find all packages needed to run the code successfully. 

Install instructions:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or via conda:
```
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

### Use

To run an example:
```
python main.py
```

### Structure

The following list describes the most important folders and files from the project, and their location:

- **/code**: contains all the code from this project
    - **/code/algorithms**: contains the code for the algorithms
    - **/code/classes**: contains the needed classes for this case
    - **/code/visualization**: contains the code for the visualization
- **/data**: contains the input data files that map the grid, batteries and houses
